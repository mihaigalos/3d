# Summary

<b>Update: </b>  RPi_Zero_Case_v4b1.stl is Pi inverted! The Pi Zero goes in with the camera connector pointing down and the Micro SD Card pointing up. This puts the power plug on the side near the bottom instead of the top. 

So I FINALLY got a Raspberry Pi Zero - just after they announced the new model with the camera connector - ugh...

Anywho. I thought I'd design a nice case for it that would look kinda stylish sitting on the desk, and not obviously yarpic (yet-another-raspberry-pi-case). Jury is out if I achieved that or not.

I thought Translucent Red would look nice, but now I think it looks yucky. Sorry. "Gold" was the other color I had handy.

Single piece. Slide the Pi in from the top. No supports needed.

You can slide the MicroSD card in and out from the bottom and there should be enough room at the top for a Pi Zero with Camera Connector as well. I'm thinking the tower/chimney effect should help with cooling.
 
I think a CPU heat sink will fit inside, but haven't tried it.

Yes, it took me 4.a tries to get a case I liked that fit/looks good...

# Print Settings

Printer Brand: RepRap
Printer: JG Aurora A3 Prusa I3
Rafts: Yes
Supports: No
Resolution: .2mm
Infill: 15% or 100%

Notes: 
Doesn't need support. The spans can be crossed just fine with a medium good printer.
You can do either 15% or 100% infill - it makes less than a meter difference in filament.
I do recommend rafting as the base is very thin and you'd hate for it to come off mid-print.


# Post-Printing

## Nasty Little Hairs

You'll probably get nasty little hairs inside unless you have one of those really nice printers and slicers. So clean them out with a small file before inserting your Pi. It will be a snug fit, but will loosen with use.


# How I Designed This

## How I did it - by Victor Von Frankenstein

I used Sketchup...because I'm a masochist.
The compound curves were a PITA.
